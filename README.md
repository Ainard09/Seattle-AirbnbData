# Installation
The code should run perfectly on python 3.*. There should be no necessary libraries to run the code.

# Project Motivations
My focus on this project was to use Seattle Airbnb data to understand;
1. Areas with most Airbnb properties and expensive areas in the city
2. Seasonal changes in price of listing
3. The factors that influence the listing price 

# File Descriptions
Two notebooks are attached,the notebooks provide extensive work of searching through the data for all above questions and related questions. They can be found on github via this link; https://github.com/Ainard09/Seattle-AirbnbData.git

# Results
The discussions of the answers about the questions can be found via this post on medium; https://medium.com/@liadiazeez3/why-you-should-consider-seattle-for-your-next-vacation-28642876d9d1
